At TakeAHikeColorado.com you can input a hike that you know you like, and it will recommend similar hikes. If you have a AllTrails username, you can provide that for tailored hike recommendations. Or if you're new to hiking in Colorado, you can simply input some information about what type of hike you want (hike distance, elevation gain, and whether or not you want to bring your dog) and it will give you the most popular hikes that match those specifications.
